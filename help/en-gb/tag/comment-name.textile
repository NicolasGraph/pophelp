h1. Comment name

bc. <txp:comment_name />

The *comment_name* tag is a _single_ tag which is used to display a link using the commenter's name as text. If an email address is supplied and allowed to be viewed, an email link is created. Otherwise, if a website is entered, the website URL is used. If neither is supplied, the name displays as plain text.

Commenter's name and/or email address can be set as a requirement. Should be used in a Textpattern 'comment' type [[Form template]].
