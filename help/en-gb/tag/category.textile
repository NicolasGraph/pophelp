bc. <txp:category />

The *category* tag can be used as either a _single_ or _containing_ tag. It will display information of the category as defined by the @name@ attribute, or the one currently being viewed. When used as a containing tag, it will turn the contents into a link to the category. Otherwise, it will return plain text.

May be used in any context.
