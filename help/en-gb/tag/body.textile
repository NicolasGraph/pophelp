h1. Body

bc. <txp:body />

The *body* tag is a _single_ tag which is used to return the text, or content, of the article being displayed (the article itself). The tag can be used in a Textpattern 'article' type [[Form template]], or within a [[Page template]], either wrapped within a given article tag, or directly in the template itself so long as the context is with a single article (as opposed to an article list).
