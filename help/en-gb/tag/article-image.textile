h1. Article image

bc. <txp:article_image />

The *article_image* tag is a _single_ tag. Textpattern will replace this tag with the @<img src="...">@ HTML tag matching the numeric ID or URL assigned when the article is posted.

The image to be associated with the tag is set in the "Write administration panel":http://docs.textpattern.io/administration/write-panel. Click 'Advanced options' and enter either the URL of the image, or the Textpattern ID (a number set by Textpattern at upload) into the *Article image* field. Most of the time you will use the image ID here. Note that you can only assign a single image to each article.
