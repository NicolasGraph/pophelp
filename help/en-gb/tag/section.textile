h1. Section

bc. <txp:section>

The *section* tag can be used as either a _single_ tag or _container_ tag. It will display information about the section as defined by either the @name@ attribute, the section currently being viewed, or the section of the article being displayed (if used within a Textpattern 'article' type [[Form template]], or an "if_individual_article":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/if-individual-article conditional tag).

When used as a containing tag, it will turn the contents into a link to that section. Otherwise, it will return plain text.
