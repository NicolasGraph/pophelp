h1. Article custom

bc. <txp:article_custom />

The *article_custom* tag is a _single_ or a _container_ tag that provides a variety of custom options for sorting, selecting, and displaying articles (the tag will be replaced with one or more articles).

If used as a container, it must be specified as an opening and closing pair of tags, like this:

bc. <txp:article_custom>
    ...contained statements...
</txp:article_custom>

This is equivalent to putting the contained statements into a form named 'my_form' and using @<txp:article_custom form="my_form" />@.

Unlike the "article":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/article tag, @<txp:article_custom>@ will always return an article list and *is not context-sensitive*. This means while the "article":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/article tag can only see posts within the currently viewed section/category/author and so forth, @<txp:article_custom />@ can see all posts from all sections, categories and authors unless you restrict it via attributes, thus context-sensitive navigation tags, such as "older":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/older and "newer":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/newer, will not work.

@<txp:article_custom />@ offers many additional attributes that @<txp:article />@ does not, but only @<txp:article />@ will produce the full single article page. If you have only @<txp:article_custom />@ on a page, rather than @<txp:article />@, then you will never reach the permalinked article page - you'll always get an article list page.

However, you can have the added features and functionality of @<txp:article_custom />@, while keeping the necessary @<txp:article />@ in full force by using conditionals: @<txp:if_individual_article>@ and @<txp:if_article_list>@, e.g.:

bc.. <txp:if_article_list>
    <txp:article_custom form="myform" limit="10" category="ideas" section="article" sortby="Posted" sortdir="desc" />
</txp:if_article_list>

<txp:if_individual_article>
    <txp:article />
</txp:if_individual_article>
