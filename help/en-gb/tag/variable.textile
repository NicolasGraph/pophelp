h1. Variable

bc. <txp:variable />

The *variable* tag is both a _single_ and a _container_ tag which sets or returns a user-defined global variable.

If used as a _container_ tag, the result of the contained statements are assigned to the given variable @name@, like this:

bc. <txp:variable>
    ...contained statements...
</txp:variable>

p(alert-block information). Note: Avoid entering white space characters for better code readability between the opening and closing _variable_ tags, they will lead to falsified results in the "if_variable":http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/if-variable evaluation.
