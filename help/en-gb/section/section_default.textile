h1. Sections: Default publishing section

This option governs which section will be pre-selected in the Section menu when creating a new article on the 'Write' administration panel.

If most of your articles end up belonging to a particular section, select it from the list here. Changes will be reflected immediately.

You can override this on a per-article basis in the 'Write' administration panel by selecting a different section in the 'Sort and display' pane.
