h1. Sections: Uses style

If you wish to override the default stylesheet for a particular section, this can be set here.

This is only relevant to stylesheets held within Textpattern 'Styles' administration panel - if you host your CSS externally of Textpattern (which is highly recommended), this option has no effect.
