h1. Diagnostics: Site URL mismatch

The Site URL as set in the 'Preferences' administration panel does not match the actual URL you use to visit your website.

If your website can be reached through multiple different URLs, or if the links on your Textpattern powered website all function correctly, you can safely ignore this warning.

Otherwise, you are advised to correct the 'Site URL' setting in Admin Preferences. An educated guess of the correct Site URL is shown in the pre-flight warning message on the 'Diagnostics' administration panel.
