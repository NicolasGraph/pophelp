h1. Diagnostics: Turn register_globals off or update to a newer PHP version

A severe vulnerability was discovered in certain versions of PHP concerning the controversial legacy feature <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php">registered globals <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a>. This can lead to unexpected behaviour of PHP applications, which can potentially allow execution of remote PHP code in many situations.

Vulnerable versions are PHP4 versions <= 4.4.0 and PHP5 versions <= 5.0.5. You should either update to a newer version or make sure that <code>register_globals</code> is turned off. <code>register_globals</code> was deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0 and removed as of PHP 5.4.0.

You can turn off <code>register_globals</code> in the <code>php.ini</code> file. If you are in a hosted environment, you may have an option in your hosting control panel for it (ask your host). When running PHP as an Apache module, it is also possible to turn <code>register_globals</code> off via Apacheâ€™s <code>.htaccess</code> configuration files. Uncomment the following line from your <code>.htaccess</code> file by removing the leading #:
