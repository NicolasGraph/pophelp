<h1 id="diagnostics-temporary-directory-path-and-plugin-cache-directory-path-should-not-match">Diagnostics: Temporary directory path and Plugin cache directory path should not match</h1>
<p>Plugins should have their own directory and not share the temporary directory. This is a potential security risk and may adversely affect your site if the temporary directory is flushed. Please ensure that the temporary directory path is different to the plugin cache path.</p>
