<h1 id="diagnostics-modified-files">Diagnostics: Modified files</h1>
<p>Files are determined to be modified if their respective checksum differs from the known-good checksum list. If any files in the Textpattern installation are different to those expected, the files will be highlighted here. This is not necessarily a problem, but may be worth checking out if you are having problems with the functionality of your site.</p>
