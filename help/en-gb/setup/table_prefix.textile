h1. Setup: Table prefix

You only need to use a table prefix if you require multiple Textpattern installations in one database. Each Textpattern installation needs a unique prefix.

Note that the prefix must adhere to the following rules:

* <strong>1st character:</strong> must be a-z, A-Z, or underscore
* <strong>Subsequent characters:</strong> can only be a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or underscore
