h1. Preferences: Publish expired articles?

When set to 'Yes', expired articles will continue to show on your site after their expiry date has elapsed. You can use <a href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/if-expired" target="_blank">@<txp:if_expired />@</a> to show alternate content or markup for expired articles.

When set to 'No', expired articles will be removed from the public site and return a "410 Gone" HTTP status instead. Visitors to an expired article will be shown a custom page template named 'error_410' if it's present.

The default setting is 'No'.
