h1. Preferences: Prevent widowed words in article titles?

"Widowed word" refers to the final word of a sentence shown on a new line when the sentence is too long to fit on one line. In printed works, widowed words are considered sloppy typography and should be avoided. Setting this preference to ‘Yes’ will ensure that long article titles lines never have only the last word on a new line. Instead, the two last words will appear on a new line.
