h1. Preferences: Permalink title URL pattern

This defines the method by which article URLs are constructed and assigned when a non-messy mode is used.

When an article is published, its URL is generated from the article title unless a specific URL is provided in in the URL-only title field.

Take the following example article title: _Alice and Belinda went Camping_

When permalink title URL pattern option is set to 'Yes', the URL for the article would be:

bc. http://example.com/alice-and-belinda-went-camping

When permalink title URL pattern option is set to 'No', the URL for the article would be:

bc. http://example.com/AliceandBelindawentCamping
