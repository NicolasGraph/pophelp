h1. Preferences: Comments mode

If ‘current window’ is selected (recommended) the current window will be refreshed to display only the current article, with comments beneath.

If ‘popup window’ is selected, a new browser window will open when the comments link is clicked (this uses the <code>popup_comments</code> form).
