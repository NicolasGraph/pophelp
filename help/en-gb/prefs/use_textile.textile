h1. Preferences: Use Textile?

<a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://textpattern.com/textile-sandbox">Textile <span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink">(opens an external link in a new window)</span></a> is a utility intended to simplify the conversion of plain text to HTML. When enabled, Textile will process the body text of articles and return structurally sound HTML.

Textile also offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of commands with which to format text, define structures such as lists, headers and blockquotes, and insert links and images.

The setting you choose here becomes the default for excerpt and body markup on the ‘Write’ administration panel. You can choose to allow complete Textile processing, to convert line breaks into HTML paragraph markers or not convert any text at all.
