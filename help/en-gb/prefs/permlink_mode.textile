h1. Preferences: URL pattern

This defines the method by which individual articles are reached via the URL displayed using the <a href="http://docs.textpattern.io/tags/permlink">@<txp:permlink>@ tag</a>.

'?=messy' mode is the most compatible - it will work with little to no configuration required - but least beneficial in terms of readability and search engine optimization (SEO). In this mode URLs for articles on your site would look like this:

bc. http://example.com/index.php?id=123

All other modes require the Apache @mod_rewrite@ module to be installed and enabled on your server. If your server does not support @mod_rewrite@ either contact your web host or use the '?=messy' mode outlined above.
