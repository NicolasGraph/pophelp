h1. Preferences: Use admin-side plugins?

Admin-side plugins can change the operation of the administration interface. They might hook into already existing actions, like editing or publishing articles, or they might add new panels for added/extended functionality.

If you would like to learn more about admin-side plugins, please see the "Extending Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Extending_Textpattern page in <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://docs.textpattern.io/">Textpattern User Documentation</a>. Plugins of all sorts are listed in the "Textpattern Resources":http://textpattern.org/ site.
