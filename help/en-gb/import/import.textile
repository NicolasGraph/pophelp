h1. Import: Import from

You can import your data into Textpattern from the following publishing tools:

* Movable Type
* Blogger
* WordPress (including custom prefixes for your databases, if youâ€™re using them)
* b2

If you choose to import from a file exported from another content management system - that is, Movable Type or Blogger - you must place it in the <code>textpattern/include/import</code> directory and name it <code>import.txt</code>.
