h1. Languages: Install Textpack

Paste additional language strings for your site into this box and click or tap 'Upload' to install them.

The strings will often come in the form of a downloadable Textpack, distributed with a plugin to permit the plugin's language strings to be used natively within Textpattern.

International authors may then translate these packs as necessary and redistribute the localised content to the community.
