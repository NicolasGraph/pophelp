<h1 id="write-body">Write: Body</h1>
<p>The main content of an article is contained within the article body.</p>
<p>When composing or preparing articles for publication in Textpattern, you can switch between three views of the article: plain text, HTML markup (the code with which a web browser renders the article), and a rendered preview.</p>
