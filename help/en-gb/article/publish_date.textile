h1. Write: Publish date

The time an article or file is published or most-recently revised. The time can be set to the moment the item is published, or to an arbitrary time in the past or future.

The boxes correspond to the following information:

* Year / Month / Day
* Hour (24-hour format) : Minute : Second

An item with a timestamp greater than the current time (i.e. in the future) will not appear on the front end and the RSS/Atom feeds until that time arrives.
