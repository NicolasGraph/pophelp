h1. Preferences: Use ISO-8859-1 encoding in emails (default is UTF-8)?

Textpattern uses UTF-8 encoding wherever possible by default, including for outgoing emails. However, some older email clients (including some versions of Microsoft Outlook) do not have proper UTF-8 support. If you encounter garbled characters in emails, this setting will convert text to ISO-8859-1 encoding before sending them.

p(alert-block information). <strong>Note:</strong> If you are using a language the characters of which cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1, this setting will unfortunately not help you. You should try finding a UTF-8 (or Unicode) compatible email client.
