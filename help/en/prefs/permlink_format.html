<h1>Preferences: Permalink title URL pattern</h1>
<p>This defines the method by which article URLs are constructed and assigned when a non-messy mode is used.</p>
<p>When an article is published, its URL is generated from the article title unless a specific URL is provided in in the URL-only title field.</p>
<p>Take the following example article title: <em>Ann and Bob eat cake</em></p>
<p>When permalink title URL pattern option is set to ‘Hyphenated (title-like-this)’, the URL for the article would be:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/ann-and-bob-eat-cake</code></pre>
<p>When permalink title URL pattern option is set to ‘Intercapped (TitleLikeThis)’, the URL for the article would be:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/AnnandBobeatcake</code></pre>
