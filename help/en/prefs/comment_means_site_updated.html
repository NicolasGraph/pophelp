<h1 id="preferences-new-comment-means-site-updated">Preferences: New comment means site updated?</h1>
<p>The Textpattern database keeps track of when the most recent change to your site took place. When this setting is set to ‘Yes’, a new comment will also update this value. This value is used for example for <code>&quot;Send Last-Modified header&quot;</code> functionality.</p>
