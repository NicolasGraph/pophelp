<h1>Preferences: Logs expire after how many days?</h1>
<p>When Textpattern logging is enabled, you can specify how long (in days) the logs should be kept. ‘7’ will keep the logs available for seven days.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The logs only get trimmed when you view the ‘Visitor logs’ administration panel, and will otherwise continue to grow in size.</p>
