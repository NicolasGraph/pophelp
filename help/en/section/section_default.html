<h1 id="sections-default-publishing-section">Sections: Default publishing section</h1>
<p>This option governs which section will be pre-selected in the Section menu when creating a new article on the ‘Write’ administration panel.</p>
<p>If most of your articles end up belonging to a particular section, select it from the list here. Changes will be reflected immediately.</p>
<p>You can override this on a per-article basis in the ‘Write’ administration panel by selecting a different section in the ‘Sort and display’ pane.</p>
