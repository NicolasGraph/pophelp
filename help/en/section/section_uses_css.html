<h1>Sections: Uses style</h1>
<p>If you wish to override the default stylesheet for a particular section, this can be set here.</p>
<p>This is only relevant to stylesheets held within Textpattern ‘Styles’ administration panel - if you host your CSS externally of Textpattern (which is highly recommended), this option has no effect.</p>
