<h2>Images: Upload thumbnail</h2>
<p>Full size images can be assigned their own thumbnails. These are useful for linking to - and the indexing of - full size images.</p>
<p>A reference to the thumbnail is exactly the same as the reference to the full size image, with <code>t</code> appended to the file name. For example, to reference a thumbnail associated with a full size image stored at <code>/images/12.jpg</code> you would use <code>/images/12t.jpg</code>.</p>
