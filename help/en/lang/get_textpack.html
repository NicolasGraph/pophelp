<h2>Languages: Install Textpack</h2>
<p>Paste additional language strings for your site into this box and select ‘Upload’ to install them.</p>
<p>The strings will often come in the form of a downloadable Textpack, distributed with a plugin to permit the plugin’s language strings to be used natively within Textpattern.</p>
<p>International authors may then translate these packs as necessary and redistribute the localized content to the community.</p>
